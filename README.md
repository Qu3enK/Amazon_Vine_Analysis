# Amazon_Vine_Analysis



The purpose of the PyBer analysis is to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May 2019 and create a visualization for the CEO, V. Isualize. We want to show the correlation of average fares compared to the total number of rides based on the total number of drivers for each city type (Urban, Suburban & Rural). The analysis and visualization will assist PyBer with improving access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods
