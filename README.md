# Amazon Vine Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of the Amazon Vine analysis is to analyze Amazon reviews written by paid Amazon Vine program members and determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in a selected dataset.  As part of the project access was granted to approximately 50 datasets; the dataset chosen for this analysis was Clothing Apparel. [1]

In order to perform the analysis, we will utilize PySpark to extract the dataset, transform the data and load into PgAdmin via AWS RDS connection. Once we had the final data results, we utilized PySpark via Google Colab to analyze the data to determine if there is any bias between Vine and Non-Vine members.
